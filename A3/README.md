# Matrix Multiplication #

### Purpose ###

The purpose of this repository is to execute multiple matrix multiplication operations in parallel. If the given files for matrices are 'A1.txt W1.txt W2.txt W3.txt', the operations that will occur simultaneously are A1\*W1, A1\*W2, A1\*W3.

### How to Run Test Cases ###

* Test cases are present in the "test" folder of this directory
* To compile C file in terminal: **gcc -o matrixmult_multiw matrixmult_multiw.c -Wall -Werror**
    * "-Wall" enables all warning messages and "-Werror" makes all warnings into errors
* To run the program with test cases in terminal: **./matrixmult_multiw test/A1.txt test/W1.txt test/W2.txt test/W3.txt**
    * "1" in the text file names can vary by test file names

### Expected Test Case Results ###

* The following is the test case result of the test case provided above:
